***What is AntUI?***

AntUI is a User Interface replacement addon for World of Warcraft - The Burning Crusade. It is designed to work with patch 2.4.3, which is what most The Burning Crusade servers typically use as their patch.

AntUI was created because I used dozens and dozens of addons for my User Interface, and often many people would ask me if I could share my UI, when I posted screenshots and what not. It's always a nuisane to share a user interface, and UI packs you find here and there require you to download dozens of addons, edit the WTF settings, set all profiles, etc. It's a drag.

AntUI is designed as a *single* addon that will take care of all of this for you. There is only one profile to set - and you're good to go. And that's the AntUI profile.

You can control each sub-addons settings in the AntUI settings if you need additional refinement.

An important thing to remember is that AntUI was not entirely developed by me. A large portion of the code is the exact same as common addons as Questhelper, Cartographer, Bagnon, etc. I am leveraging these addons because it is much easier than re-designing EVERYTHING. So with that being said, a lot of the credit of this addon goes to those original authors, 10 years ago.
